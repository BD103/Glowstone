## Getting Started

These commands should help you get setup with the standard workflow:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/BD103/Glowstone.git
$ poetry lock
$ poetry install
$ python -m glowstone
```

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage its dependencies.
If you want to use another environment, check out [Ballad](https://github.com/BD103/Ballad)

## Building

This program uses PyInstaller to build.
We are working on getting the application working first before we package the thing.
